# GitHubRepoTracker
You are tasked with building a GitHub Repository Activity Connector. This connector should authenticate using a personal access token and retrieve a list of public repositories for a given GitHub user or organization. For each repository, fetch the last 20 commits along with the commit message, author, and timestamp.
